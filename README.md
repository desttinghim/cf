# cf

Java `.class` file parser for Zig. Mainly extracted from [jaz](https://github.com/zig-java/jaz).

## Tests

```bash
javac test/cf/test/*.java
zig test cf.zig
```

## Usage

Take a look at tests in `src` to get a sense of how to use `cf`! To actually integrate it in your application, reference `cf.zig` in your `build.zig` and enjoy. :)
